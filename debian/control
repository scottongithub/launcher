Description: Infinity version of Flashpoint
 Flashpoint is a desktop application used to browse, manage and play games from
 BlueMaximaâ€™s Flashpoint library.
 The Infinity version (this one) downloads a game's files on-demand rather than
 keep them all locally The Ultimate version (currently not packaged) has all
 files locally and so will take up much more space.
